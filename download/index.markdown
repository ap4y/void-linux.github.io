## Download installable base live images and rootfs tarballs

All **live images** and **rootfs tarballs** are available at:

- [{{ site.download_mirror }}]({{ site.download_mirror }})

These files can also be downloaded from other mirrors, which are listed [in the documentation](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/mirrors/index.html).
Simply navigate to `live -> current` to find them.

The requirements for these images can be found [in the documentation](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/index.html#base-system-requirements).
An internet connection via Ethernet or WiFi is required for network installation.

### Verifying file integrity and its digital signature

Prior to using any image you're strongly encouraged to validate the
signatures on the image to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
The process for validating these keys can be found [in the
documentation](https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/index.html#downloading-installation-media).
